Configuration - Profiles
========================

Profiles continue where suites left you off. Where suites allow you to run different 
tests in their specific contexts, profiles allow you to run tests in different environments.

One environment could be your local development environment, while another would be a contiuous integration
environment, such as Travis or Jenkins.

Custom Autoloading
------------------

Sometimes when you need to place your ``features`` folder somewhere else than the
default location (e.g. ``app/features``). All you need to do is specify the path
you want to autoload via ``behat.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # behat.yml

    default:
        autoload:
            '': %paths.base%/app/features/bootstrap
                
.. note::

    Using ``behat.yml`` to autoload will only allow for ``PSR-0``
    You can also use ``composer.json`` to autoload, which will also
    allow for ``PSR-4``
